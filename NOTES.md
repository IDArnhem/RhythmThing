## Collaborating in a Unity project

The easiest and "free" way of doing this is to use Github. Follow these steps:

- install the Unity Github package http://unity.github.com
- import it as a plugin into your project
- you will also need `git-lfs`, which you can install in your mac using Homebrew, like this: `brew install git-lfs`
- now you have everything installed
- our common project is hosted in this shared github repository: https://github.com/IDArnhem/RhythmThing.git
- clone it form Unity Git
- create a branch with your name, that will create a development line just for you that will hopefully not affect the work of others
- happy hacking!
