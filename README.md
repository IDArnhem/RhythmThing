## RhythmThing

This is a game built during the Unity Evenings at ArtEZ Arnhem by a group of students and some teachers that were interesting in going deeper into Unity.

The goals of the game were to build something fun, collective in that we all build it together and it can be played by many at the same time and that has an important physical aspect to the interactions, both from the players perspective (movement) and from the perspective of game dynamics (digital artifacts that have an effect in the physical world), we figured that a good way of putting this to practice was to build some kind of musical instrument.

We learn Unity as we go along.

Here are some [notes of some important learning points](NOTES.md) that we found along the way.
